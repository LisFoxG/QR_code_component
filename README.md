### What I learned

I tried to position card in center using display:grid and it worked pretty well. Also i used preprocessor SASS with custom nullstyle.

```html
<h1>Some SCSS code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.wrapper{
	display: grid;
	grid-template:1fr 497px 1fr/1fr 320px 1fr;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
	background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
	font-family: Outfit;
}
```
### Continued development

Unfortunately i have a bad time understanding all grid properties, so gotta focus on that.

### Useful resources
