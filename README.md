### What I learned

I tried to position card in center using display:grid and it worked pretty well



```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

Unfortunately i have a bad time understanding all grid properties, so gotta focus on that.
